# Passage Lighting System with Passive Infrared Motion Detection

## Description

The Passage Lighting System with Passive Infrared Motion Detection is an intelligent and energy-efficient solution designed for lighting in big corridors or passages. It utilizes passive infrared (PIR) motion detection sensors to detect human presence and automatically adjust the lighting based on the person's movement.

By strategically installing multiple PIR motion detection sensors along the corridor, the system can identify the person's position and gradually illuminate the area they are approaching. This ensures optimal lighting precisely where it's needed, providing convenience and safety while conserving energy when the corridor is not in use.

## Features

- Energy-efficient lighting system using PIR motion detection sensors.
- Adjustable sensitivity and range settings for precise motion detection.
- Gradual lighting based on the person's proximity to the sensors.
- Customizable time delay for the lights to turn off after the person leaves the area.
- Low-power mode for energy conservation during periods of inactivity.
